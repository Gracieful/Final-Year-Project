## Softwares used 

* Unreal Engine - version 5.1.1
* TouchDesigner - Non Comerical - version 2023.11510

## How to Install

* Download the files. 
* Once the files have been downloaded, run the Touchdesigner file "MediaPipe_set.toe" and the Unreal Engine file "TouchDesigner_UE5". Make sure you are running the Unreal Engine project file from the project folder. Touchdesigner may take a few moments to find a webcam on your device.
* In the Unreal Engine project, select the level "OSC_Server4" in the "Content" folder. You can do this while waiting on TouchDesigner.  (the previous levels are from different stages of testing) 
* Once Touchdesigner has dected your camera, click the play button in unreal Engine and your eye movement should trigger the relavant animations.
